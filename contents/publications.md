#### Suzhou University of Science and Technology | Suzhou, China

* **Engineered a Dual-Layer RAG Architecture for Legal Statute Retrieval:** Developed a sophisticated retrieval system for Chinese legal texts, featuring a high-level module for multi-round query decomposition and verification, and a low-level module for atomic question variant generation. Optimized retrieval precision through multi-stage recall, de-duplication, and weighted re-ranking algorithms to handle complex legal queries.
* **Architected Label-Controlled Augmentation and Model Distillation:** Curated a dataset of 1,255 trial transcripts and 100 expert-labeled cases. Proposed an **Instruction-based Label-controlled Data Augmentation** strategy using exhaustive subset and stratified sampling to reconstruct diverse training samples. Executed a **Teacher-Student distillation** pipeline on a local **4×RTX 4090D cluster**, leveraging a 72B LLM to train a 1.5B lightweight model for high-fidelity fact extraction.
* **Production Deployment and Intellectual Property Achievements:** Successfully deployed the system at the **Suzhou Arbitration Institute** to support real-world labor dispute resolutions. Generated significant academic and legal-tech impact by securing **4 authorized invention patents as the primary inventor** and 2 accepted software copyrights based on the project's core algorithmic innovations.
